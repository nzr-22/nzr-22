### Hi, I'm Nazar 👋

I'm a **QA Lead & Scrum Master** with 12+ years of experience in the industry. I specialize in automation, performance testing, and helping teams run smoothly using Agile/SAFe.

Currently, I'm bridging the gap between technical testing (getting hands-on with code) and process leadership (making sure we ship on time).
